    {
      question: `How was InfoPortal created?`,
      answer: `InfoPortal was first initiated within the Danish Refugee Council's Ukraine mission to overcome the challenges of traditional <b>Information Management Systems</b>. 
  Over more than two years, it was continuously developed and improved, until it became clear that the solution could benefit organizations far beyond DRC. 
  The platform has since been redesigned to work across organizations, in a flexible and fully generic way.`,
    },
    {
      question: `What's the added value of InfoPortal compared to existing solutions?`,
      answer: `Most information management workflows today are fragmented across multiple tools that were never designed to work together. 
  For example, data might be collected in KoboToolbox, exported to Excel, and then visualized in Power BI - therefore without proper access management or a reliable single source of truth. 
  This often leads to <b>scattered</b> systems, corrupted data and a <b>loss of the overall picture</b>. 
  InfoPortal solves this by bringing collection, integration, management, and visualization together into one secure, cohesive platform.`,
    },
    {
      question: `When will the final product be launched?`,
      answer: `InfoPortal is currently in its final stages of development. 
  We plan to open early access to selected partners within the coming months, with a wider public launch expected later this year. 
  Join the waitlist to stay informed and get early updates.`,
    },
    {
      question: `How will the data be protected?`,
      answer: `Data protection is at the core of InfoPortal. 
  All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, and stored on secure, <b>GDPR-compliant infrastructure</b>. 
  Access rights can be finely managed to ensure that only authorized users can view or edit sensitive information. 
  We follow industry best practices to safeguard your data and your users' privacy.`,
    },
    {
      question: `Will it be free?`,
      answer: `Yes. <b>A free tier</b> will be available for personal use, students, and small teams. 
  For larger organizations, we will offer affordable pricing plans designed to cover infrastructure costs and ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform.`,
